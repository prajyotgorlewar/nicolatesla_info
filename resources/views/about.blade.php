            <p class="mb-4">Welcome to the Nikola Tesla Info website, where we delve into the fascinating life of one of history's most brilliant minds. Nikola Tesla, born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan (modern-day Croatia), was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and visionary whose pioneering work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries left an indelible mark on the world.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Tesla's journey began in a family deeply rooted in innovation and intellectual pursuits. His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest and writer, while his mother, Georgina ƒêuka Tesla, came from a family of inventors. Young Nikola displayed an early aptitude for engineering and a profound curiosity about the natural world.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States, seeking to work with the renowned inventor Thomas Edison. Their collaboration was short-lived due to differing views on electrical systems, particularly Tesla's advocacy for alternating current (AC) over Edison's direct current (DC). This marked the beginning of Tesla's solo journey into the realms of electrical engineering.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Tesla's breakthrough came with the invention of the induction motor and transformer, crucial components of the AC system. His innovations laid the groundwork for the development of the modern power distribution systems that power homes and industries worldwide. The success of AC technology earned Tesla recognition and partnerships, but financial struggles plagued much of his life.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The rivalry between Tesla and Edison reached its peak during the "War of Currents," a battle to determine the dominant electrical system. Despite facing numerous challenges, Tesla's AC system eventually triumphed, transforming the way electricity was generated, transmitted, and utilized.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Beyond his contributions to electrical engineering, Tesla's inventive spirit knew no bounds. He held over 300 patents, including the Tesla coil, an innovation crucial to wireless communication and radio technology. His visionary ideas extended to wireless transmission of energy, robotics, and even the concept of a global wireless communication network, reminiscent of today's internet.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">However, Tesla's later years were marred by financial difficulties and relative obscurity. Despite his numerous achievements, he struggled to translate his groundbreaking ideas into commercial success. In 1943, Nikola Tesla passed away in New York City, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence science, technology, and popular culture.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Nikola Tesla's life is a testament to the power of curiosity, perseverance, and the unyielding pursuit of knowledge. His inventions and ideas have shaped the modern world in ways he might never have imagined during his lifetime. This website is dedicated to exploring the intricate details of Tesla's life, his innovative spirit, and the enduring impact of his contributions on our technological landscape.</p>
